define CROSSPLANE_MAKE_HELP
Crossplane Targets:
    cobertura             Generate a coverage report for cobertura applying exclusions on generated files.
    submodules            Update the submodules, such as the common build scripts.
    run                   Run crossplane locally, out-of-cluster. Useful for development.
